# Image Steganography

This project demonstrates image steganography in Python, a technique for hiding text or image data within another image. Using this program, you can securely encode and decode messages or images within a cover image without significantly altering the cover image's appearance.

## Features

- **Encode text or image data** into a cover image.
- **Decode hidden data** from a steganographic image.
- Supports **grayscale and RGB** images.
- Uses the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** method to hide information efficiently.
  
## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `Pillow` for image processing.
 

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install pillow
